### Description:

This script will remove entries from the Home Assistant restore state.

This is meant to remove "hilo_energy" entities as some orphan states
might cause issues with the utility meters in Home Assistant.

A backup will be taken before writing anything to the file.

Make sure that Home Assistant is stopped before running the script
